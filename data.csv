"Love love love","LOVE THESE! I upgraded to these after my periods AirPods got broken by my toddler and I am so so happy I decided to make the switch! Not only does the battery last me forever, the noise cancellation is AMAZING! I wear them with noise cancellation on even when I’m not listening to anything just because it is that good. They are super comfy in my ears as well! Not to mention, they don’t fall out nearly as easily as the standard AirPods tend to do!","05 Jul 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","Gina","5.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_prev_1?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1"
"Great for driving tractors","I was hesitant to purchase these, becasue there wasn't data to support how many decibels the noise cancellation actually cancels. I still don't know how much it cancels out, but I love them! I wear them when driving a no cab JD 4010 tractor wide open. It blocks most of the tractor noise out, and I don't even have to have the volume turned up high. I also wear them while driving the skid steer. It does a great job of blocking out the back ground noise. If someone calls me while on a very loud tractor, I can hear them great, but they have trouble hearing me, which is totally understandable. I can have conversations with people while in the skid steer. The skid steer doesn't run too loud that people can't hear me during conversation. These airpods are very handy. I work in construction, and it is very convenient to be able to walk around the job site and talk on the phone without having to have my phone in my hand. Another great benefit is that I can leave my phone on the charger and walk around my house talking to someone on the phone. I also wear them while walking or jogging. I live in the country and don't have side walks to walk on. I walk/jog down the road. Even with the noise cancellation I can still hear most all vehicles when they are coming from behind. I've only been startled a few times. I really love that the airpods charge in the case, so you can get many hours of use, before you actually have to charge the case. My only compliant is that if I am talking on the phone without the airpods and then put one or both in my ears, it does take several seconds for it to connect to the airpods. During that time it will flip between the airpods and the phone and it can be confusing for the person you are speaking to. It does best when I put the airpod in before I answer the phone.","05 Jul 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","meg","5.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_prev_1?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1"

"Good,but room for improvement","I first want to say that I love these headphones. For the current price point, I feel that they are a great value. I love the noise-cancelling. It's definitely noticeable. I was amazed at the difference. It literally feels like it silences the world around you.It was so good that I had to turn the noise cancelling off in order to hear my TV in my house. I want to say that the only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't like the fact that u cant adjust the volume on the airpods themselves, you have to do it on your phone.","05 Jul 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","Gil","4.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_prev_1?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=1"

"Great if you don’t have a firmware problem","Worked great for 3 days and then they wouldn’t connect to my phone. Apparently some AirPods Pro have different firmware in each AirPod so they stop connecting and it’s a hassle. They say it’s like a glitch in them.

The buds receive and deliver great sound. With phone calls and conferencing, the quality impressed me.

"Can’t connect to iPhone11","This was my second try  at AirPods Pro. I’ve returned both and will stick with my Jabras. I have an iPhone 11 and even after literally hours on the phone with Apple troubleshooting, etc.,pairing was very intermittent leading to terrible frustration and disappointment.

Cons-  Battery life isn't what they say, it's the MOST disappointing aspect. - Cord is confusing??? One end is the lightening plug, other end is android plug?????? luckily I had past cords - NO POWER ADAPTER,  I spent over $230, Apple-- you cheap-asses, you guys can't include a square power adapter?  DAMN......... - When doing task, they fall out easier, and when I bend over to pick up something they fall out - NO in ear hooks to keep them from falling out, had to buy them on the side.....

"Poor customer support between Amazon and Apple for warranty","After about four months, they started to make a ""scratching"" sound in the left ear.  Went to Amazon to check out warranty, but since I am four months out they redirect to Apple.  Went to an Apple store, they told me to download app and it would synch the serial number and I could submit a RMA for a replacement, overnight!  Apple App does not pick up the serial number when synched.  So, when purchases made on Amazon do not synch with your Apple account.  Now, made second appointment with Apple store, outsourced to Best Buy because they are overloaded and  website won't schedule appointments further than one week, but due to CV19, no one can get an appointment at an Apple store. Summary: Beware when buying Apple products on Amazon.  They do not synch serial and order information for warranty replacements; unless you pay for the super special extra bonus vip platinum Apple loyalty skymiles fees.  Overrated!!!

"Questionable quality and bad support","Airpod Pros were great for about 4 months.  After some moderate use, the left airpod developed clicking and buzzing and became non-useable.  I understand that sometimes these things happen, however Apple support with the matter was a complete nightmare. After multiple phone calls to Apple support and more than 4 hours of my time, Apple is sending a ""DIY replacement"" left-ear airpod.  However, they are charging my credit card until I send them back my broken left-airpod.  So in the time of COVID, I have to make a trip to UPS and literally send back a freakin' ear bud to Apple!  I paid $250 for these, is there not some margin for an occasional replacement earbud for customers?!  Geez the greed of this company knows no bounds.

Since she has been working exclusively from home since the pandemic, they have been her go to for daily conference calls and listening to music while working. Both her personal and work phones are iPhones, so the interface works perfectly. For comparison, i have a pair of Sony WH-1000X3's. While I love them for the quality, the interface is no where as smooth as the AirPods Pro when it comes to interfacing with both my iPhone and my iMac. Another great features is the multiple sized earpieces. This has allowed her to really customize the fit of them and maximize sound quality and comfort. The only complaint she has had is that she wishes the battery life lasted longer as they cannot make it through multiple daily conference calls. I recommend this product, especially for anyone already using apple products throughout their daily life.","02 Jul 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","Surfrider0414","5.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_8?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=8"

"Good noise suppression poor sound quality","Bluetooth noise cancellation earbuds provides convenience at the cost of audio quality. There is simply no way there are going to beat a good pair of wired headphones. But even I was surprised by just had bad these were. IF you turn off noise cancellation you could get about 85% of the sound quality of my cheap $9 Hypergear earbuds and 70% of my Bowers & Wilkins C5 Series 2.  The active noise cancellation will literally destroy your high end and while EQ could help somewhat it simply can't bring back what is not there. If you are looking for social status or just like helping Apple makes a few more billion then by all means get these. The fit and comfort is outstanding. If you are looking to listen to some good music get a decent pair of wired headphones.","01 Jul 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","Nomad8888","3.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_10?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=10"

The old AirPods fit with no issue but I seem to be somewhere between a large and medium for my right ear and they won’t stay in.

"Ear pieces won't stay in - back to last gen AirPods!","I'm typically an Apple product fan. I swear by the AirPods, and even loved the wired EarPods. But I had to return these AirPods Pro. No matter which size ear piece I tried, even buying highly-rated after market memory foam ear pieces, the things just didn't want to stay in. And when I tried keeping them in with, my ears end up hurting. They wanted to slip out just sitting on the couch, laying down, talking or eating. Hoping they'd stay in while walking, working out, running - no way that was happening. The sound quality was 4/5 (very rare, slight crackles on certain notes/sounds - most probably wouldn't even notice). The noise cancellation actually blew my mind the first time I used it outside. And the transparency mode is nice when you want to hear what's going on around you but don't want to the AirPods Pro out of your ears. But the cumbersome ear feel, discomfort, constant ""slipping out"" sensation - this is a dealbreaker for me. Especially for $250. So it's back to the 2nd gen AirPods for me. A few less ""extras"" but they stay in my ears (sometimes I forget I even have them in!) whether I'm sitting on my butt or running several miles. Hopefully Apple designs earpieces that fit like AirPods/EarPods - then I'll give them another shot. Until then, I'm perfectly content with my 2nd-gen AirPods.","01 Jul 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","Ryan Rawlings","2.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_11?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=11"

"Make sure you got the 2 year extended guarantee.","I am on the third pair now, thank God for the 2 year guarantee. Straight to the point. - Sound is amazing when the noise canceling is active when is not sound exactly like regular Airpods. - Noise cancellation is fantastic, such a weird feeling the first couple of weeks  before you get use to it. - They look awesome and stay in my ears pretty good. - Battery is pretty good too but i wouldn't mind for an extra hour. So .... what is the problem??? Let me start. After 3 months the right ear piece start making crackling sound when noise cancellation is on and you cough or talk loud, slightly noticeable at the begging but it gets worse and worse. So I replace it and all was fine. Then the left start doing the same thing. Replaced it again. Pretty happy for my new Airpods Pro again thinking that My first pair was faulty. WRONG.... Again the same story. Now I am on the third pair and I know it is going to happen again. If you check the forums there are thousands of people having the same problem. Like I said they work flawlessly with my iPhone, iWatch and my mac, but only for 3-4 months. I am very disappointed with that product but I was lucky to listen the guy at the apple store and get the protection plan. Something else. the problem disappear if you use them with out the noise cancellation but then why you just don't get the not Pro ones. If you get them ... GET THE PROTECTION PLAN.","30 Jun 2020","Style: AirPods","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wliKC-amL._SY88.jpg

"Toxic Smell Out of the Box","These AirPods gave off the most toxic, nauseating fumes out of the box. I googled to see if this was an issue and saw that some people said their AirPods Pro smelled like blueberries. A berry fragrance would have been fine but this was not it. I got a terrible headache from the odor when I tried on the AirPods. I even suspected it might have been counterfeit but I checked, and they appear to be legit. It functioned fine. I would have returned them but my husband was fine with the smell.","29 Jun 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","anithology","3.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_14?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=14"
"What could go wrong, DID!","First,  I've been using Amazon for 21 years (since '99! Wow!) and this is the first product I've ever given a negative review and the very first that I am returning. These things are terrible.  Seriously.  No really,  TERRIBLE! After a week,  the right ear piece stopped working.  It looked fully charged,  then seconds later it had 11%,  then jumped to 98%,  then to 13%, back and forth.  I left it in the case, thinking I needed to charge it again for whatever reason.  Next time I looked it was 100%,  still didn't work.  I tried lots of different things, nothing. Oh,  but the left ear piece DID work!  Well,  for another couple of days,  then it gave me the low power sound in the middle of my workout one morning,  I hadn't used them for 24 hours,  surely the charge in the case for 23 hours would be enough? Oh no...  that night I charged them up, and the next day I got the low power warning during the workout,  and this time they shut off.  Really. Oh hey,  but the right side had 100%,  oh but that's right,  that one doesn't work! Then I look at the percentage of the case...  it's dead.  It had charged all night the night before...  Now it's dead. Not.Even.Kidding. I am preparing my return package as I type this.  I don't want them to replace them,  I just want to get out of this AirPod PRO Hell. I will say something nice...  in the 3 times I was able to use them with both ears,  they were able to cancel out the noise around me.  So,  there's that. I had the original AirPods and gave them to my son (what was I thinking?),  they were way more reliable than this junk.  I am thoroughly disappointed in Apple.","29 Jun 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","Jill","1.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_14?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=14"

"Not for audiophiles, but everyone else will be extremely satisfied.","I bought these for noise cancellation specifically and to see what a premium set of earbuds was offering. Noise cancellation is great, blocks out running air conditioning, background TV and a loud rotary fan. I wasn't aware of the transparency mode until I used them and read the manual. This feature took it from a great product to an amazing value. Noise cancellation offers me the isolation I want when I need it. Sometimes, you just need to be in your own world of quiet, Airpods Pro delivers on that. When I listen to my audiobooks, I want to be able to have someone ask me a question without needing to remove my earbuds, transparency mode also works really well for calming sounds like rainfall or a calming background music without making those sounds the only thing you hear. It offers the best of isolation from and integration with outside sounds with a long push of either stem. Works great for phone calls too, not much else to say about that.","27 Jun 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","Nicole","5.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_18?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=18"

I have used the Transparency, Off, and Noise Cancellation settings for different situations and, so far, have no complaints. Unfortunately, my right ear doesn't hold the AirPod in if I get sweaty from working out, and I've had both fall out alternatively as I got sweaty, but honestly, the sound makes up for it. I do wish there was a way to skip a song or change the volume within the AirPods themselves, but they're already so small and sleek, so I can't really complain.

"These are the BEST","I have weird ears, they repel anything I stick in them; just falls right out.  I was hesitant to order them, due to price and whether they would work for me and ears.  First try, didn't really understand how to use them and was tempted to return. I asked my 17 yr old for help, he has the regular not the pro, we discovered they are different so after watching YouTube videos on tips and tricks, these things are amazing. With the touch of a button you can turn the noise cancelling on and off, pause, skip or go back on songs (works great with Amazon music) and works well with my iPhone, iPad and MacBook, no need for me to switch it seems to know which one I am using.  Due to working from home (COVID) and my 2 kids being at home, these have been a real game changer for zoom meetings and even FaceTime.  I love the wireless charging option and how you can see the battery life of both air pods and the case. I highly recommend these for anyone who likes to work in the quiet but may need to hear what's going on around them.","26 Jun 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","Cat Johnson","5.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_21?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=21"

"Awful sound for $250 extremely poor noise cancellation","What is the hype about? I really wonder. I expected big things from these headphones, $250, Apple, all this advertised “technology”, surely these things can’t be that bad right? These are $250. I am looking for something to replace my Bose sound sport frees as the notorious left ear problem is now getting to be a bit too much for me to want to deal with, I thought. I had owned an original pair of AirPods but they didn’t comfortably fit my ear and the sound quality then wasn’t very good for how much they were. So here I am with these new AirPod pros, the sound is super tinny, mids and highs are all over the place, the sound is screechy, sounds awful. I tried all 3 of the tip sizes but it doesn’t do much because directly behind the tip is a giant mounting point that for me is uncomfortable after about 20 minutes no matter what ear tips I use. The noise cancellation has to be a joke, for something that is so strongly advertised, it seriously is a joke. It cannot even process out my bathroom fan while i sit at my desk. My Bose QC 35 have no issues with that. I know these are two completely different types of headphones but this is the type of noise cancellation ive been accustomed to as Apple has always been synonymous with Bose before the beats merger. Anyway; I am terribly unimpressed with these headphones for this price. The truly value of the value with this sound quality is no more than $50; that being said these are maybe worth $100. I guess you could maybe stretch that to $150 if you have your biggest tin foil on. Overall, I’ll for sure be returning these, extremely disappointed. And I will continue my search for something to replace my large, ugly and cumbersome Bose sound sports.","26 Jun 2020","Style: AirPods","","","Amazon Customer","1.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_22?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=22"

"Bought on a whim","Bit the bullet on a whim. Told myself walking into Walmart, “if they have AirPods Pro I’ll buy those in lieu of ear plugs” so they did, and I did. They work amazingly. Under the helmet voice commands aren’t as great as they are without, but that’s to be expected. Under 50% max noise level on my quieter(so) helmet they work with choice fine. Up to around 55mph with voice commands. Rode up to 75mph and were just as effective at blocking out the wind noise on the helmet as the earplugs. Though I’m fairly certain they were in noise cancelling mode instead of off.

"For those on the fence, buy the AirPods Pro","The AirPods Pro has been a great investment. From the ANC features to the tight integration across the Apple ecosystem, this product is seamless to use, sounds great, and is just a pleasure to have around. Pairing takes less than 5 seconds, the eartips are swappable to make the fit as tight as possible, and its use cases are varied. I wear these all the time, sometimes with one airpod in my ear so I can balance listening to podcasts while doing activities. It also supports audio sharing natively which is a great feature to use with friends. On top of that, Apple is actively improving the AirPods via firmware upgrades with spatial audio coming as part of iOS 14. My only gripe is its shorter battery life compared to competitors like the Sony WF-1000XM3s or PowerBeats. However, the seamlessness and great ANC makes up for it very quickly. If you're on the fence - go get these.","24 Jun 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","JR617","5.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_26?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=26"

"Lots of good things and one horrible thing","Let's start with the good: The noise cancellation is great.  The controls are much easier and more intuitive than with regular airbuds or other earbuds.  I could take calls on it, which I can't do with other earbuds.  They were mostly comfortable. Not good: There's not enough variety in the silicon tips - none fit, and they kept falling out of one ear.  I would have had to order tips from another seller.  The charging cord seems to be designed for a new product that isn't included.  Luckily you can use iPhone cords and cubes to charge them.  It's just mean to sell a high-priced product that still requires you to buy more accessories. Why I'm returning them: They don't play well with an Apple Watch, especially with the Audible app.  The audio apps will freeze on the phone (but not other apps).  A song will play for ten seconds, and then drop off.  This ONLY happens with Airpods Pro. It doesn't happen with my nice Bose, and it doesn't happen with my budget workout headphones.  It's odd, but it's a common problem based upon the number of people who have been complaining about it.","23 Jun 2020","Style: AirPods","","","Michael Cain","2.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_27?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=27"
"Sleek look","I got these as a gift for Father’s Day. He set them up and was amazed with the noise cancelling since that was the first thing he noticed. They are pretty sleek looking. Everything about these is worth the price though we both questioned about charging. The box came with a charging cord but to plug in to charge the wireless charger, you would need an adapter as it was noted in the little booklet. Without the adapter, you are able to charge the wireless case using the standard Apple charger. Other than the charging mishap, everything seems fine and easy to set up since there is a step by step guide.","23 Jun 2020","Style: AirPods","","Verified Purchase","Gabby","5.0","Apple AirPods Pro","https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_27?ref_=s9_apbd_otopr_hd_bw_b2Y4ZnX&pf_rd_r=VMPMPB2ZGVBH80EDBFN1&pf_rd_p=f8a4773f-1e2c-5333-86b4-bb3f5fc870f6&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-11&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=2335752011&th=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=27"
